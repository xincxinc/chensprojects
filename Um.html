                <h3>USELESS MOMENTS OF MODERN LIFE</h3>
                <h1>U.M.</h1>
                <p>“Time you enjoy wasting, was not wasted.“ People in modern life want their every moment to be useful and precious. But what is really precious? Useless Moment is a timer, a bracelet for Women. Every single pearl represents 5 minutes. So a Maximum of 30 minutes can be set at one time. It’s not so accurate as a watch. But why should it be?</p>

                <h3>Preciousness of Time</h3>
                <p>Time is precious. People in the modern life try to make good use of time. We rush. We give out most of our time to work in order to gain money or success. But what is really valuable? How about time with ourselves and time with families?
                    <strong>This project is about TIME.</strong>

                <p style="width: 55%;"><strong>Moment for Expecting</strong><br/>Ally is an office lady. It’s a Friday. Ally finished her work earlier. She quickly went back home and changed a tulle skirt which she never wore at work. She planed to watch a film with her friend today. She arrived 20 minutes earlier at the cinema. She didn’t want to be late because she likes the director. Her friend hadn’t arrived. So she set a time on the bracelet and waited with full expectancy.</p>

                <p style="float: right; width: 25%;"><strong>Moment for Breathing</strong><br/>Ally is very hardworking. She can keep working for long time. But she found that the longer she works, the lower efficiency she has. So she decided to take a good rest at lunch time. She set her bracelet and took a walk in the park near her office. The air in the park refreshed her mind. And the moment helped her keep a little distance from the busy work.</p>
